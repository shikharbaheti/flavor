# Introduction

Flavor is an app created for the Capital One Software Engineering Summit 2020. The app utilizes Yelp's Fusion API to search and return businesses based on the location inputs of the user. The app displays the locations of the businesses on a Google Maps API map and uses Geocoding to translate coordinates to text and vice versa.â€‹

The app can be found live at: flavorproject.appspot.com

## Capital One Software Engineering Summit

Capital One Software Engineering Summit is a week long program for freshman and sophomores to learn more about Capital One's startup-minded and innovative culture while also exploring and developing technology and problem solving skills valued by top tech employers. 

## Why I wish to attend SES

I wish to attend SES to know more about Capital One's technological culture and to see if I can find myself being part of it in the future. I wish to improve my soft skills along with learning about latest technologies by hands on experience. Lastly, I wish to network with other peer students and Capital One leadership to gain knowledge from their experiences.

## Built
The application was built by using NodeJS as the backend server to make API calls and using Express as a web server. The webpage also utilizies jQuery, BootStrap, and Google Fonts to improve the user experience.

## Road 
In the future, I wish to provide an ability for users to upload images to the website and find the nearest businessess who either serve that food or have it in stock using Google ML Models. Furthermore, I wish to provide a better price and calorie overview of foods to the users so that they can make better choises. Lastly, I wish to provide easy access to recepies to users so that they can make their desired food at home, saving money and living healthy. 

## Challenges
The biggest challenge that I faced while completing this assignment was to design the UI/UX design. I was constantly reconsidering where I should place the map and how to organize the information in the cards. Lastly, I also was having issues templating HTML through JavaScript information and then doing functions on it. I had to switch frameworks from Mustache to Handlebars for it. 

## What I learnt
I learned a lot about project management and how to break down a big project into smaller manageable tasks (using Trello) to tackle them more efficiently. I learned how to manage my time between completing this app along with homework, assignments, and tests during the school semester. Lastly, I learned how to use APIs and how to manipulate HTML with JavaScript (learning jQuery).
